# Risk control in agile methods #

- Agile methods promote either _risk-driven_, _customer-driven_ or combination of both

- Risk-driven means that the team prioritizes high those tasks that have high risk.

- Customer-driven means that the team prioritizes high those tasks that the customer wants

- In combination of both, the team makes customer see why high-risk tasks must be prioritized high.

- Risks are quite smaller than in "traditional" projects. Since work is done iteratively, if disaster strikes we lose at most the iterations worth of work. Iterations are usually 2-6 weeks, so this is not much.

- Of course, previous point doesen't take into account the fact the bad decision can come up several iterations later, which means we lose more than just one iterations worth of work (in worst case scenario)

- Agile methods are very robust against change. Agile manifesto: "Responding to change over following a plan."

- Therefore, ability to acommodate new risks is very good in agile methods.

- Also, agile methods foster much more (inter-personal) communication than "traditional" methods.

- This could lead to risks to get attention early on.
