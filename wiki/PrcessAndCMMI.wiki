= Introduction to CMMI =

*CMMI* (Capability Maturity Model Integration) is follower to  Capability Maturity Model (*CMM*), which was initially created as an abstract model for the military to use as an objective evaluation of software subcontractors.

CMMI is a collection of best practices that meet the needs of organizations in different areas of interest. A collection of best practices that cover a particular area of interest is called a _CMMI model_. These models are:
 # _Development_, addresses product and service development processes.
 # _Acquisition_, addresses supply chain management, acquisition, and outsourcing processes in government and industry.
 # _Services_, addresses guidance for delivering services within an organization and to external customers.

All CMMI models contain multiple Process Areas (*PA*). A PA has 1 to 4 goals, and each goal is comprised of practices which describe specific activities in each PA. An additional set of (generic) goals and practices applies across all of the process areas. 


= Agile processes & CMMI =

General problem is to map the qualities of agile processes to CMMI goals and practices. 

Some mapping efforts have been done:
 * Agile+ (!AgileTek, basically extended XP to meet CMMI Level 3)
 * Microsoft Solutions Framework (Version 4 was agile “with some overhead” to achieve CMMI Level 3 consistency)
 * ASCEND (BAE Systems, claims CMMI Level 5 compatibility)

Possible areas of friction:

 # Empowerment and trust versus micromanagement
   * Process and Product Quality Assurance
   * Compliance (perhaps?) becomes the focus, not effective practices justified by results
 # Elaboration and review of intermediate work products
   * How much is enough to “define” and “elaborate”...
      # requirements before?
      # design and interfaces before?
      # implementation and testing?
   * What is sufficient review?
   * Is bi-directional traceability necessary? To what level?
 # Organization standards versus project standards
   * Agile teams determine their own process and practices by consensus
   * Question: Does CMMI tailoring guidance allow project team data or consensus to overrule
      # Organizational standards?
      # Accumulated organizational performance data?
   * _Otherwise, process performers are no longer the process owners_
 # If we modify CMMI a lot, is it still CMMI?
   * "We're _basically_ CMMI lvl 4."
   * "Show me the certificate."
   * "..."
