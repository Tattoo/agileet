Analyses on the video and the transcript lead to following observations:

(1) Basic usage is clear and concise in almost all views. Error and success messages contribute a lot to users' understanding.

(2) There is an UI bug in add event where you cannot insert date in correct format. All 

(3) Ranking graph doesen't show clearly players with same amount of points -> confusion about the graph working correctly.

(4) The basic idea of tracking scores cumulated from rankings in different games isn't inherently intuitive idea. 

Conclusions based on analyses:

(1) Textual helpers could be added more. All actions need to report somehow to user. In add ranking, it is probably more intuitive for user to first select game and then places. 

(2) Bug must be fixed (out of scope?)

(3) Maybe adding opacity to colors contribute to understanding the graph better

(4) Is the basic premise of ranking in the software wrong or just domain specific information?
